# Ubuntu Community Catalyst 
Ubuntu Community Catalyst is a â€œneighborhood development platform" that works with community leaders to identify systemic issues and create plans to dismantle them. The website itself serves as a connective tissue between Ubuntu and the community. The website allows anyone interested in the cause to actively involve themselves at any time whether that involves donating money or volunteering their time. The main goal of the Ubuntu Community Catalyst Website Rebuild is to find ways where user interaction can increase. With this in mind and input from the organization, we will be implementing different features where community input will be actively present. 
  1. Calendar
  2. Blog
  3. e-Commerce
  4. Project pages, etc.
